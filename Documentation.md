### Hypothesis
    Violent crime, as well as non-violent crime (burglary, etc.) occurs most in areas with high populations, as well as cityscape areas with a high magnitude of abandoned urban infrastructure like Gosford. Additionally, high delinquency raises crime rates and contibutes to the overall crime rates in a suburb.
